StreamingServer
===============
This is part of project for my graduation paper.
Firstly you may have to clone or fork it into your own github and then run ./rebuild to build DarwinStreamingServer.
APICommon\QTSSTSFileSessionModule is a new module added to support TS (Transport Streaming) and adaptive streaming.
Good luck!
